# Capstone Project: Smart Fire Sprinkler

This repository contains the software for my Undergraduate Capstone Project. **The goal was to create a smart fire sprinkler to combat the water damage caused by conventional fire sprinklers due to their indiscriminate spray pattern**. A single conventional fire sprinkler pumps out 15 gallons of water per minute, resulting in potentially catastrophic damage even after the fire has been extinguished.
