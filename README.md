# Capstone Project: Smart Fire Sprinkler

This repository contains the software for my Undergraduate Capstone Project. **The goal was to create a smart fire sprinkler to combat the water damage caused by conventional fire sprinklers due to their indiscriminate spray pattern**. A single conventional fire sprinkler pumps out 15 gallons of water per minute, resulting in potentially catastrophic damage even after the fire has been extinguished. Please see our project elevator pitch below:
